Powerstore E-commerce site

An E-commerce side project for strength equipment store built in React JS, which offers a wide choice of product categories, has a cart management system, user authentication, and allows users to place orders.

The main technological tools that I used for this project are Redux, Formik, and Firebase. I also used the Axios library for fetching and sending data and Redux Persist for persisting state.
